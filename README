== Description ==

	phOS is a little toy OS that I'm developing in order to learn about
operating systems. 

== Prerequisites ==

The following tools are needed to compile and test the project.

Compile
	- gcc		4.5.2
	- g++		4.5.2
	- nasm		2.09.04
	- gnu make	3.81
	- gnu ld	2.21.0.20110327

Test	
	- genisoimage	2.01 (mkisofs)
	- qemu		0.14.0
	- bochs		2.3.7

== Compiling ==

	If you have all the tools in PATH a simple make should compile the project.

== Testing ==
	
	To run the kernel in qemu just type 'make qemu-start' or 'make bochs-start'
for bochs.

== Licensing ==

The project is licensed under GNU GPL v3. See $(PROJECT_ROOT)/doc/gpl.txt for more details.
