== Description ==

	phOS is a little toy OS that I'm developing in order to learn about
operating systems. 

== Prerequisites ==

	I'm using Ubuntu Jaunty for development and so I'm using the following
tools versions. It could be possible for the project to compile with different
versions of the tools but these versions are the ones that I use.

Compile
	- gcc		4.3.3
	- nasm		2.05.01
	- gnu make	3.81
	- gnu ld	2.19.1

Test	
	- genisoimage	1.1.9 (mkisofs)
	- qemu		0.10.0
	- bochs		2.3.7

== Compiling ==

	If you have all the tools in PATH a simple make should compile the project.

== Testing ==
	
	To run the kernel in qemu just type 'make qemu-start' or 'make bochs-start'
for bochs.
