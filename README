== Description ==

	phOS is a little toy OS that I'm developing in order to learn about
operating systems.

tools versions. It could be possible for the project to compile with different
versions of the tools but these versions are the ones that I use.

	- gcc		4.3.3
	- nasm		2.05.01
	- gnu make	3.81
